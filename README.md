Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I am currently a student studying cyber security. My main focus is on learning and understanding different security protocols and technologies.
I am also learning Python and its various libraries and frameworks. I am interested in using it for security automation and penetration testing.

You can find some of my projects related to cyber security and Python on my profile. Feel free to take a look and give feedback.

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you find it informative.
