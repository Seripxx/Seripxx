## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I am currently working as an **IT Support Officer**. I have finished a Cert IV & Advanced Diploma of Cyber Security as well as a Cert IV & Diploma of Website Development through Holmesglen Tafe. I will be studying my Bachelor of Cyber Security part time through Swinburne University here in Melbourne starting this July 2024. I'm unsure of my goals right now and where I want to go in this field. But I enjoy making tools for my work like the clickToDial extension I have made. 


You can find some of my projects related to cyber security and other projects on my profile. Feel free to take a look and give feedback. I am still new to this and trying to keep as many doors open before finding my niche.

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you find it informative.
